[SpaceTraders](https://spacetraders.io/) is a multiplayer programming game where the players use an
[HTTP-API](https://spacetraders.stoplight.io/docs/spacetraders) to manage a fleet of ships for
exploring, trading, and fighting their way across the multiplayer universe.

This project provides a [Go](https://go.dev/) [module](https://go.dev/ref/mod) for interacting with the game.
